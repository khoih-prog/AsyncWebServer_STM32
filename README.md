### Why do we need this [AsyncWebServer_STM32 library](https://github.com/khoih-prog/AsyncWebServer_STM32)

#### Features

- Using asynchronous network means that you can handle **more than one connection at the same time**
- **You are called once the request is ready and parsed**
- When you send the response, you are **immediately ready** to handle other connections while the server is taking care of sending the response in the background
- **Speed is OMG**
- **Easy to use API, HTTP Basic and Digest MD5 Authentication (default), ChunkedResponse**
- Easily extensible to handle **any type of content**
- Supports Continue 100
- **Async WebSocket plugin offering different locations without extra servers or ports**
- Async EventSource (Server-Sent Events) plugin to send events to the browser
- URL Rewrite plugin for conditional and permanent url rewrites
- ServeStatic plugin that supports cache, Last-Modified, default index and more
- Simple template processing engine to handle templates

This library is based on, modified from:

1. [Hristo Gochkov's ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)

to apply the better and faster **asynchronous** feature of the **powerful** [ESPAsyncWebServer Library](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer) into STM32 boards using builtin LAN8742A Ethernet.

---

#### Currently Supported Boards

1. Nucleo-144 (F429ZI, F746ZG, F756ZG, F767ZI)
2. Discovery STM32F746G-DISCOVERY
3. Any STM32 boards with enough flash/memory and already configured to run LAN8742A Ethernet.

## Important things to remember

- This is fully asynchronous server and as such does not run on the loop thread.
- You can not use yield() or delay() or any function that uses them inside the callbacks
- The server is smart enough to know when to close the connection and free resources
- You can not send more than one response to a single request

---

## Principles of operation

### The Async Web server

- Listens for connections
- Wraps the new clients into ```Request```
- Keeps track of clients and cleans memory
- Manages ```Rewrites``` and apply them on the request url
- Manages ```Handlers``` and attaches them to Requests

### Request Life Cycle

- TCP connection is received by the server
- The connection is wrapped inside ```Request``` object
- When the request head is received (type, url, get params, http version and host),
  the server goes through all ```Rewrites``` (in the order they were added) to rewrite the url and inject query parameters,
  next, it goes through all attached ```Handlers```(in the order they were added) trying to find one
  that ```canHandle``` the given request. If none are found, the default(catch-all) handler is attached.
- The rest of the request is received, calling the ```handleUpload``` or ```handleBody``` methods of the ```Handler``` if they are needed (POST+File/Body)
- When the whole request is parsed, the result is given to the ```handleRequest``` method of the ```Handler``` and is ready to be responded to
- In the ```handleRequest``` method, to the ```Request``` is attached a ```Response``` object (see below) that will serve the response data back to the client
- When the ```Response``` is sent, the client is closed and freed from the memory

### Rewrites and how do they work

- The ```Rewrites``` are used to rewrite the request url and/or inject get parameters for a specific request url path.
- All ```Rewrites``` are evaluated on the request in the order they have been added to the server.
- The ```Rewrite``` will change the request url only if the request url (excluding get parameters) is fully match
  the rewrite url, and when the optional ```Filter``` callback return true.
- Setting a ```Filter``` to the ```Rewrite``` enables to control when to apply the rewrite, decision can be based on
  request url, http version, request host/port/target host, get parameters or the request client's localIP or remoteIP.
- The ```Rewrite``` can specify a target url with optional get parameters, e.g. ```/to-url?with=params```

### Handlers and how do they work

- The ```Handlers``` are used for executing specific actions to particular requests
- One ```Handler``` instance can be attached to any request and lives together with the server
- Setting a ```Filter``` to the ```Handler``` enables to control when to apply the handler, decision can be based on
  request url, http version, request host/port/target host, get parameters or the request client's localIP or remoteIP.
- The ```canHandle``` method is used for handler specific control on whether the requests can be handled
  and for declaring any interesting headers that the ```Request``` should parse. Decision can be based on request
  method, request url, http version, request host/port/target host and get parameters
- Once a ```Handler``` is attached to given ```Request``` (```canHandle``` returned true)
  that ```Handler``` takes care to receive any file/data upload and attach a ```Response```
  once the ```Request``` has been fully parsed
- ```Handlers``` are evaluated in the order they are attached to the server. The ```canHandle``` is called only
  if the ```Filter``` that was set to the ```Handler``` return true.
- The first ```Handler``` that can handle the request is selected, not further ```Filter``` and ```canHandle``` are called.

### Responses and how do they work

- The ```Response``` objects are used to send the response data back to the client
- The ```Response``` object lives with the ```Request``` and is freed on end or disconnect
- Different techniques are used depending on the response type to send the data in packets
  returning back almost immediately and sending the next packet when this one is received.
  Any time in between is spent to run the user loop and handle other network packets
- Responding asynchronously is probably the most difficult thing for most to understand
- Many different options exist for the user to make responding a background task

### Template processing

- AsyncWebserver_STM32 contains simple template processing engine.
- Template processing can be added to most response types.
- Currently it supports only replacing template placeholders with actual values. No conditional processing, cycles, etc.
- Placeholders are delimited with ```%``` symbols. Like this: ```%TEMPLATE_PLACEHOLDER%```.
- It works by extracting placeholder name from response text and passing it to user provided function which should return actual value to be used instead of placeholder.
- Since it's user provided function, it is possible for library users to implement conditional processing and cycles themselves.
- Since it's impossible to know the actual response size after template processing step in advance (and, therefore, to include it in response headers), the response becomes [chunked](#chunked-response).

## Request Variables

### Common Variables

```cpp
request->version();       // uint8_t: 0 = HTTP/1.0, 1 = HTTP/1.1
request->method();        // enum:    HTTP_GET, HTTP_POST, HTTP_DELETE, HTTP_PUT, HTTP_PATCH, HTTP_HEAD, HTTP_OPTIONS
request->url();           // String:  URL of the request (not including host, port or GET parameters)
request->host();          // String:  The requested host (can be used for virtual hosting)
request->contentType();   // String:  ContentType of the request (not avaiable in Handler::canHandle)
request->contentLength(); // size_t:  ContentLength of the request (not avaiable in Handler::canHandle)
request->multipart();     // bool:    True if the request has content type "multipart"
```

### Headers

```cpp
//List all collected headers
int headers = request->headers();
int i;

for(i=0;i<headers;i++)
{
  AsyncWebHeader* h = request->getHeader(i);
  Serial.printf("HEADER[%s]: %s\n", h->name().c_str(), h->value().c_str());
}

//get specific header by name
if(request->hasHeader("MyHeader"))
{
  AsyncWebHeader* h = request->getHeader("MyHeader");
  Serial.printf("MyHeader: %s\n", h->value().c_str());
}

//List all collected headers (Compatibility)
int headers = request->headers();
int i;

for(i=0;i<headers;i++)
{
  Serial.printf("HEADER[%s]: %s\n", request->headerName(i).c_str(), request->header(i).c_str());
}

//get specific header by name (Compatibility)
if(request->hasHeader("MyHeader"))
{
  Serial.printf("MyHeader: %s\n", request->header("MyHeader").c_str());
}
```

### GET, POST and FILE parameters

```cpp
//List all parameters
int params = request->params();

for(int i=0;i<params;i++)
{
  AsyncWebParameter* p = request->getParam(i);
  
  if(p->isFile())
  { 
    //p->isPost() is also true
    Serial.printf("FILE[%s]: %s, size: %u\n", p->name().c_str(), p->value().c_str(), p->size());
  } 
  else if(p->isPost())
  {
    Serial.printf("POST[%s]: %s\n", p->name().c_str(), p->value().c_str());
  } 
  else 
  {
    Serial.printf("GET[%s]: %s\n", p->name().c_str(), p->value().c_str());
  }
}

//Check if GET parameter exists
if(request->hasParam("download"))
  AsyncWebParameter* p = request->getParam("download");

//Check if POST (but not File) parameter exists
if(request->hasParam("download", true))
  AsyncWebParameter* p = request->getParam("download", true);

//Check if FILE was uploaded
if(request->hasParam("download", true, true))
  AsyncWebParameter* p = request->getParam("download", true, true);

//List all parameters (Compatibility)
int args = request->args();

for(int i=0;i<args;i++)
{
  Serial.printf("ARG[%s]: %s\n", request->argName(i).c_str(), request->arg(i).c_str());
}

//Check if parameter exists (Compatibility)
if(request->hasArg("download"))
  String arg = request->arg("download");
```

### JSON body handling with ArduinoJson

Endpoints which consume JSON can use a special handler to get ready to use JSON data in the request callback:

```cpp
#include "AsyncJson.h"
#include "ArduinoJson.h"

AsyncCallbackJsonWebHandler* handler = new AsyncCallbackJsonWebHandler("/rest/endpoint", [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request, JsonVariant &json) 
{
  JsonObject& jsonObj = json.as<JsonObject>();
  // ...
});

server.addHandler(handler);
```

```cpp
AsyncWebServerResponse *response = request->beginChunkedResponse("text/plain", [](uint8_t *buffer, size_t maxLen, size_t index) -> size_t 
{
  //Write up to "maxLen" bytes into "buffer" and return the amount written.

  return mySource.read(buffer, maxLen);
});

response->addHeader("Server","AsyncWebServer_STM32");
request->send(response);
```

### Chunked Response containing templates

Used when content length is unknown. Works best if the client supports HTTP/1.1

```cpp
String processor(const String& var)
{
  if(var == "HELLO_FROM_TEMPLATE")
    return F("Hello world!");
    
  return String();
}

// ...

AsyncWebServerResponse *response = request->beginChunkedResponse("text/plain", [](uint8_t *buffer, size_t maxLen, size_t index) -> size_t 
{
  //Write up to "maxLen" bytes into "buffer" and return the amount written.
  //index equals the amount of bytes that have been already sent
  //You will be asked for more data until 0 is returned
  //Keep in mind that you can not delay or yield waiting for more data!
  return mySource.read(buffer, maxLen);
}, processor);

response->addHeader("Server","AsyncWebServer_STM32");
request->send(response);
```

### Print to response

```cpp
AsyncResponseStream *response = request->beginResponseStream("text/html");
response->addHeader("Server","AsyncWebServer_STM32");
response->printf("<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>Webpage at %s</title></head><body>", request->url().c_str());

response->print("<h2>Hello ");
response->print(request->client()->remoteIP());
response->print("</h2>");

response->print("<h3>General</h3>");
response->print("<ul>");
response->printf("<li>Version: HTTP/1.%u</li>", request->version());
response->printf("<li>Method: %s</li>", request->methodToString());
response->printf("<li>URL: %s</li>", request->url().c_str());
response->printf("<li>Host: %s</li>", request->host().c_str());
response->printf("<li>ContentType: %s</li>", request->contentType().c_str());
response->printf("<li>ContentLength: %u</li>", request->contentLength());
response->printf("<li>Multipart: %s</li>", request->multipart()?"true":"false");
response->print("</ul>");

response->print("<h3>Headers</h3>");
response->print("<ul>");
int headers = request->headers();

for(int i=0;i<headers;i++)
{
  AsyncWebHeader* h = request->getHeader(i);
  response->printf("<li>%s: %s</li>", h->name().c_str(), h->value().c_str());
}

response->print("</ul>");

response->print("<h3>Parameters</h3>");
response->print("<ul>");

int params = request->params();

for(int i=0;i<params;i++)
{
  AsyncWebParameter* p = request->getParam(i);
  
  if(p->isFile())
  {
    response->printf("<li>FILE[%s]: %s, size: %u</li>", p->name().c_str(), p->value().c_str(), p->size());
  } 
  else if(p->isPost())
  {
    response->printf("<li>POST[%s]: %s</li>", p->name().c_str(), p->value().c_str());
  } 
  else 
  {
    response->printf("<li>GET[%s]: %s</li>", p->name().c_str(), p->value().c_str());
  }
}

response->print("</ul>");

response->print("</body></html>");
//send the response last
request->send(response);
```

### ArduinoJson Basic Response

This way of sending Json is great for when the result is **below 4KB**

```cpp
#include "AsyncJson.h"
#include "ArduinoJson.h"


AsyncResponseStream *response = request->beginResponseStream("application/json");
DynamicJsonBuffer jsonBuffer;
JsonObject &root = jsonBuffer.createObject();
root["heap"] = ESP.getFreeHeap();
root["ssid"] = WiFi.SSID();
root.printTo(*response);

request->send(response);
```

### ArduinoJson Advanced Response

This response can handle really **large Json objects (tested to 40KB)**

There isn't any noticeable speed decrease for small results with the method above

Since ArduinoJson does not allow reading parts of the string, the whole Json has to be passed every time a 
chunks needs to be sent, which shows speed decrease proportional to the resulting json packets

```cpp
#include "AsyncJson.h"
#include "ArduinoJson.h"

AsyncJsonResponse * response = new AsyncJsonResponse();
response->addHeader("Server","AsyncWebServer");
JsonObject& root = response->getRoot();
root["IP"] = Ethernet.localIP();
response->setLength();

request->send(response);
```
---

## Param Rewrite With Matching
It is possible to rewrite the request url with parameter matchg. Here is an example with one parameter:
Rewrite for example "/radio/{frequence}" -> "/radio?f={frequence}"

```cpp
class OneParamRewrite : public AsyncWebRewrite
{
  protected:
    String _urlPrefix;
    int _paramIndex;
    String _paramsBackup;

  public:
  OneParamRewrite(const char* from, const char* to)
    : AsyncWebRewrite(from, to) 
    {

      _paramIndex = _from.indexOf('{');

      if( _paramIndex >=0 && _from.endsWith("}")) 
      {
        _urlPrefix = _from.substring(0, _paramIndex);
        int index = _params.indexOf('{');
        
        if(index >= 0) 
        {
          _params = _params.substring(0, index);
        }
      } 
      else 
      {
        _urlPrefix = _from;
      }
      
      _paramsBackup = _params;
  }

  bool match(AsyncWebServerRequest *request) override 
  {
    if(request->url().startsWith(_urlPrefix)) 
    {
      if(_paramIndex >= 0) 
      {
        _params = _paramsBackup + request->url().substring(_paramIndex);
      } 
      else 
      {
        _params = _paramsBackup;
      }
      
      return true;

    } 
    else 
    {
      return false;
    }
  }
};
```

Usage:

```cpp
  server.addRewrite( new OneParamRewrite("/radio/{frequence}", "/radio?f={frequence}") );
```
---

## Using filters

Filters can be set to `Rewrite` or `Handler` in order to control when to apply the rewrite and consider the handler.
A filter is a callback function that evaluates the request and return a boolean `true` to include the item
or `false` to exclude it.

---

## Bad Responses

Some responses are implemented, but you should not use them, because they do not conform to HTTP.
The following example will lead to unclean close of the connection and more time wasted
than providing the length of the content

### Respond with content using a callback without content length to HTTP/1.0 clients

```cpp
//This is used as fallback for chunked responses to HTTP/1.0 Clients
request->send("text/plain", 0, [](uint8_t *buffer, size_t maxLen, size_t index) -> size_t 
{
  //Write up to "maxLen" bytes into "buffer" and return the amount written.
  //You will be asked for more data until 0 is returned
  //Keep in mind that you can not delay or yield waiting for more data!
  return mySource.read(buffer, maxLen);
});
```
---

## Async WebSocket Plugin

The server includes a web socket plugin which lets you define different WebSocket locations to connect to
without starting another listening service or using different port

### Async WebSocket Event

```cpp

void onEvent(AsyncWebSocket * server, AsyncWebSocketClient * client, AwsEventType type, void * arg, uint8_t *data, size_t len)
{
  if(type == WS_EVT_CONNECT)
  {
    //client connected
    Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] connect\n", server->url(), client->id());
    client->printf("Hello Client %u :)", client->id());
    client->ping();
  } 
  else if(type == WS_EVT_DISCONNECT)
  {
    //client disconnected
    Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] disconnect: %u\n", server->url(), client->id());
  } 
  else if(type == WS_EVT_ERROR)
  {
    //error was received from the other end
    Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] error(%u): %s\n", server->url(), client->id(), *((uint16_t*)arg), (char*)data);
  } 
  else if(type == WS_EVT_PONG)
  {
    //pong message was received (in response to a ping request maybe)
    Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] pong[%u]: %s\n", server->url(), client->id(), len, (len)?(char*)data:"");
  } 
  else if(type == WS_EVT_DATA)
  {
    //data packet
    AwsFrameInfo * info = (AwsFrameInfo*)arg;
    
    if(info->final && info->index == 0 && info->len == len)
    {
      //the whole message is in a single frame and we got all of it's data
      Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] %s-message[%llu]: ", server->url(), client->id(), (info->opcode == WS_TEXT)?"text":"binary", info->len);
      
      if(info->opcode == WS_TEXT)
      {
        data[len] = 0;
        Serial.printf("%s\n", (char*)data);
      } 
      else 
      {
        for(size_t i=0; i < info->len; i++)
        {
          Serial.printf("%02x ", data[i]);
        }
        
        Serial.printf("\n");
      }
      
      if(info->opcode == WS_TEXT)
        client->text("I got your text message");
      else
        client->binary("I got your binary message");
    } 
    else 
    {
      //message is comprised of multiple frames or the frame is split into multiple packets
      if(info->index == 0)
      {
        if(info->num == 0)
          Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] %s-message start\n", server->url(), client->id(), (info->message_opcode == WS_TEXT)?"text":"binary");
          
        Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] frame[%u] start[%llu]\n", server->url(), client->id(), info->num, info->len);
      }

      Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] frame[%u] %s[%llu - %llu]: ", server->url(), client->id(), info->num, (info->message_opcode == WS_TEXT)?"text":"binary", info->index, info->index + len);
      
      if(info->message_opcode == WS_TEXT)
      {
        data[len] = 0;
        Serial.printf("%s\n", (char*)data);
      } 
      else 
      {
        for(size_t i=0; i < len; i++){
          Serial.printf("%02x ", data[i]);
        }
        Serial.printf("\n");
      }

      if((info->index + len) == info->len)
      {
        Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] frame[%u] end[%llu]\n", server->url(), client->id(), info->num, info->len);
        
        if(info->final)
        {
          Serial.printf("ws[%s][%u] %s-message end\n", server->url(), client->id(), (info->message_opcode == WS_TEXT)?"text":"binary");
          
          if(info->message_opcode == WS_TEXT)
            client->text("I got your text message");
          else
            client->binary("I got your binary message");
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Methods for sending data to a socket client

```cpp
//Server methods
AsyncWebSocket ws("/ws");
//printf to a client
ws.printf((uint32_t)client_id, arguments...);
//printf to all clients
ws.printfAll(arguments...);
//send text to a client
ws.text((uint32_t)client_id, (char*)text);
ws.text((uint32_t)client_id, (uint8_t*)text, (size_t)len);
//send text to all clients
ws.textAll((char*)text);
ws.textAll((uint8_t*)text, (size_t)len);
//send binary to a client
ws.binary((uint32_t)client_id, (char*)binary);
ws.binary((uint32_t)client_id, (uint8_t*)binary, (size_t)len);
ws.binary((uint32_t)client_id, flash_binary, 4);
//send binary to all clients
ws.binaryAll((char*)binary);
ws.binaryAll((uint8_t*)binary, (size_t)len);
//HTTP Authenticate before switch to Websocket protocol
ws.setAuthentication("user", "pass");

//client methods
AsyncWebSocketClient * client;
//printf
client->printf(arguments...);
//send text
client->text((char*)text);
client->text((uint8_t*)text, (size_t)len);
//send binary
client->binary((char*)binary);
client->binary((uint8_t*)binary, (size_t)len);
```

### Direct access to web socket message buffer

When sending a web socket message using the above methods a buffer is created.  Under certain circumstances you might want to manipulate or populate this buffer directly from your application, for example to prevent unnecessary duplications of the data.  This example below shows how to create a buffer and print data to it from an ArduinoJson object then send it.

```cpp
void sendDataWs(AsyncWebSocketClient * client)
{
    DynamicJsonBuffer jsonBuffer;
    JsonObject& root = jsonBuffer.createObject();
    root["a"] = "abc";
    root["b"] = "abcd";
    root["c"] = "abcde";
    root["d"] = "abcdef";
    root["e"] = "abcdefg";
    size_t len = root.measureLength();
    AsyncWebSocketMessageBuffer * buffer = ws.makeBuffer(len); //  creates a buffer (len + 1) for you.
    
    if (buffer) 
    {
        root.printTo((char *)buffer->get(), len + 1);
        
        if (client) 
        {
            client->text(buffer);
        } 
        else 
        {
            ws.textAll(buffer);
        }
    }
}
```

### Limiting the number of web socket clients

Browsers sometimes do not correctly close the websocket connection, even when the close() function is called in javascript.  This will eventually exhaust the web server's resources and will cause the server to crash.  Periodically calling the cleanClients() function from the main loop() function limits the number of clients by closing the oldest client when the maximum number of clients has been exceeded.  This can called be every cycle, however, if you wish to use less power, then calling as infrequently as once per second is sufficient.

```cpp
void loop(){
  ws.cleanupClients();
}
```

---

## Async Event Source Plugin

The server includes EventSource (Server-Sent Events) plugin which can be used to send short text events to the browser.
Difference between EventSource and WebSockets is that EventSource is single direction, text-only protocol.

### Setup Event Source on the server

```cpp
AsyncWebServer server(80);
AsyncEventSource events("/events");

void setup()
{
  // setup ......
  events.onConnect([](AsyncEventSourceClient *client)
  {
    if(client->lastId())
    {
      Serial.printf("Client reconnected! Last message ID that it got is: %u\n", client->lastId());
    }
    
    //send event with message "hello!", id current millis
    // and set reconnect delay to 1 second
    client->send("hello!",NULL,millis(),1000);
  });
  
  //HTTP Basic authentication
  events.setAuthentication("user", "pass");
  server.addHandler(&events);
  // setup ......
}

void loop()
{
  if(eventTriggered){ // your logic here
    //send event "myevent"
    events.send("my event content","myevent",millis());
  }
}
```

### Setup Event Source in the browser

```javascript
if (!!window.EventSource) 
{
  var source = new EventSource('/events');

  source.addEventListener('open', function(e) 
  {
    console.log("Events Connected");
  }, false);

  source.addEventListener('error', function(e) 
  {
    if (e.target.readyState != EventSource.OPEN) 
    {
      console.log("Events Disconnected");
    }
  }, false);

  source.addEventListener('message', function(e) 
  {
    console.log("message", e.data);
  }, false);

  source.addEventListener('myevent', function(e) 
  {
    console.log("myevent", e.data);
  }, false);
}
```

## Remove handlers and rewrites

Server goes through handlers in same order as they were added. You can't simple add handler with same path to override them.
To remove handler:

```arduino
// save callback for particular URL path
auto handler = server.on("/some/path", [](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
  //do something useful
});

// when you don't need handler anymore remove it
server.removeHandler(&handler);

// same with rewrites
server.removeRewrite(&someRewrite);

server.onNotFound([](AsyncWebServerRequest *request){
  request->send(404);
});

// remove server.onNotFound handler
server.onNotFound(NULL);

// remove all rewrites, handlers and onNotFound/onFileUpload/onRequestBody callbacks
server.reset();
```
---

## Setting up the server

```cpp
#include <LwIP.h>
#include <STM32Ethernet.h>
#include <AsyncWebServer_STM32.h>

// Enter a MAC address and IP address for your controller below.
#define NUMBER_OF_MAC      20

byte mac[][NUMBER_OF_MAC] =
{
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x01 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x02 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x03 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x04 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x05 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x06 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x07 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x08 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x09 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x0A },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x0B },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x0C },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x0D },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x0E },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x0F },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x10 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x11 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x12 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x13 },
  { 0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0x32, 0x14 },
};
// Select the IP address according to your local network
IPAddress ip(192, 168, 2, 232);

AsyncWebServer    server(80);

const int led = 13;

void handleRoot(AsyncWebServerRequest *request)
{
  digitalWrite(led, 1);
  request->send(200, "text/plain", String("Hello from AsyncWebServer_STM32 on ") + BOARD_NAME );
  digitalWrite(led, 0);
}

void handleNotFound(AsyncWebServerRequest *request)
{
  digitalWrite(led, 1);
  String message = "File Not Found\n\n";

  message += "URI: ";
  //message += server.uri();
  message += request->url();
  message += "\nMethod: ";
  message += (request->method() == HTTP_GET) ? "GET" : "POST";
  message += "\nArguments: ";
  message += request->args();
  message += "\n";

  for (uint8_t i = 0; i < request->args(); i++)
  {
    message += " " + request->argName(i) + ": " + request->arg(i) + "\n";
  }

  request->send(404, "text/plain", message);
  digitalWrite(led, 0);
}

void setup(void)
{
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(led, 0);

  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("\nStart Async_HelloServer on " + String(BOARD_NAME));

  // start the ethernet connection and the server
  // Use random mac
  uint16_t index = millis() % NUMBER_OF_MAC;

  // Use Static IP
  //Ethernet.begin(mac[index], ip);
  // Use DHCP dynamic IP and random mac
  Ethernet.begin(mac[index]);

  server.on("/", HTTP_GET, [](AsyncWebServerRequest * request)
  {
    handleRoot(request);
  });

  server.on("/inline", [](AsyncWebServerRequest * request)
  {
    request->send(200, "text/plain", "This works as well");
  });

  server.onNotFound(handleNotFound);

  server.begin();

  Serial.print(F("HTTP EthernetWebServer is @ IP : "));
  Serial.println(Ethernet.localIP());
}

void loop(void)
{
}
```
---

### Setup global and class functions as request handlers

```cpp
#include <Arduino.h>

#include <LwIP.h>
#include <STM32Ethernet.h>
#include <AsyncWebServer_STM32.h>

#include <functional>

...

void handleRequest(AsyncWebServerRequest *request){}

class WebClass 
{
public :
  AsyncWebServer classWebServer = AsyncWebServer(81);

  WebClass(){};

  void classRequest (AsyncWebServerRequest *request){}

  void begin()
  {
    // attach global request handler
    classWebServer.on("/example", HTTP_ANY, handleRequest);

    // attach class request handler
    classWebServer.on("/example", HTTP_ANY, std::bind(&WebClass::classRequest, this, std::placeholders::_1));
  }
};

AsyncWebServer globalWebServer(80);
WebClass webClassInstance;

void setup() 
{
  // attach global request handler
  globalWebServer.on("/example", HTTP_ANY, handleRequest);

  // attach class request handler
  globalWebServer.on("/example", HTTP_ANY, std::bind(&WebClass::classRequest, webClassInstance, std::placeholders::_1));
}

void loop() 
{

}
```

### Methods for controlling websocket connections

```cpp
  // Disable client connections if it was activated
  if ( ws.enabled() )
    ws.enable(false);

  // enable client connections if it was disabled
  if ( !ws.enabled() )
    ws.enable(true);
```


### Adding Default Headers

In some cases, such as when working with CORS, or with some sort of custom authentication system, 
you might need to define a header that should get added to all responses (including static, websocket and EventSource).
The DefaultHeaders singleton allows you to do this.

Example:

```cpp
DefaultHeaders::Instance().addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
webServer.begin();
```

*NOTE*: You will still need to respond to the OPTIONS method for CORS pre-flight in most cases. (unless you are only using GET)

This is one option:

```cpp
webServer.onNotFound([](AsyncWebServerRequest *request) 
{
  if (request->method() == HTTP_OPTIONS) {
    request->send(200);
  } else {
    request->send(404);
  }
});
```

### Path variable

With path variable you can create a custom regex rule for a specific parameter in a route. 
For example we want a `sensorId` parameter in a route rule to match only a integer.

```cpp
  server.on("^\\/sensor\\/([0-9]+)$", HTTP_GET, [] (AsyncWebServerRequest *request) 
  {
      String sensorId = request->pathArg(0);
  });
```
*NOTE*: All regex patterns starts with `^` and ends with `$`

To enable the `Path variable` support, you have to define the buildflag `-DASYNCWEBSERVER_REGEX`.


For Arduino IDE create/update `platform.local.txt`:

`Windows`: C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\\`{espxxxx}`\hardware\\`espxxxx`\\`{version}`\platform.local.txt

`Linux`: ~/.arduino15/packages/`{espxxxx}`/hardware/`{espxxxx}`/`{version}`/platform.local.txt

Add/Update the following line:
```
  compiler.cpp.extra_flags=-DDASYNCWEBSERVER_REGEX
```

For platformio modify `platformio.ini`:
```ini
[env:myboard]
build_flags = 
  -DASYNCWEBSERVER_REGEX
```

*NOTE*: By enabling `ASYNCWEBSERVER_REGEX`, `<regex>` will be included. This will add an 100k to your binary.

### Debug

Debug is enabled by default on Serial. Debug Level from 0 to 4. To disable, change the _ETHERNET_WEBSERVER_LOGLEVEL_ to 0

```cpp
// Use this to output debug msgs to Serial
#define ASYNCWEBSERVER_STM32_DEBUG_PORT       Serial
// Use this to disable all output debug msgs
// Debug Level from 0 to 4
#define _ASYNCWEBSERVER_STM32_LOGLEVEL_       0
```

### Troubleshooting

If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of Arduino IDE, the Arduino `STM32` core or depending libraries.

Sometimes, the library will only work if you update the `STM32` core to the latest version because I'm always using the latest cores /libraries.

If you connect to the created configuration Access Point but the ConfigPortal does not show up, just open a browser and type in the IP of the web portal, by default `192.168.4.1`.
